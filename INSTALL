Installing neso
===============

Prerequisites
-------------

 * Python 2.5 or later (http://www.python.org/)
 * tryton 1.4 or later (http://www.tryton.org/)
 * trytond 1.4 or later (http://www.tryton.org/)

Installation
------------

Once you've downloaded and unpacked a neso source release, enter the
directory where the archive was unpacked, and run:

    python setup.py install

Note that you may need administrator/root privileges for this step, as
this command will by default attempt to install neso to the Python
site-packages directory on your system.

For advanced options, please refer to the easy_install and/or the distutils
documentation:

  http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html

To use without installation, run ``bin/neso`` from where the archive was
unpacked. You must have tryton and trytond unpacked inside neso folder.
